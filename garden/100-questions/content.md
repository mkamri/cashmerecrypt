# About This Questionnairre

Back in the old days of the internet, these lists of questions seemed to float around every fandom and internet group. I remember having a lot of fun filling these out on Deviantart and Ye Olde Facebook :)

As a throwback to the olden days, I've completed this lolita-specific template from 2001.

If you're interested in viewing the original questions or filling it out yourself, please check out [Raine Dragon's translation](https://www.rainedragon.com/100-questions-to-lolita-2001-quiz/).

Covering myself in lace and beauty, as well as being able to get creative with different coordinates. Lolita makes me feel like I look on the outside how I feel on the inside.

---

**11 On the contrary, what is the most disgusting thing?**

I actually left lolita about 5 years ago for a few reasons, namely body image issues and shopping addiction. Not all lolitas struggle with this, but I definitely used to.

Ummm.. some default iPhone tone (sadly)

---

1-2 at this point, because of work. I'm hoping to get the courage to start wearing simple coords to the office!

**26 Please tell us the most embarrassing episode you had when you were a beginner in Lolita fashion.**

Doing a whole photoshoot in a very ita coord, showing my petticoat... I was wearing a silky white button-down from a department store, a Lip Service skirt with a light pink petticoat showing underneath, school-style under the knee socks and black mary jane's. I guess the shoes were okay but the rest was horrible~

The below photo is not from said photoshoot, but a similar "coord" from that time in which I shoved a petticoat under a dress from the supermarket...
