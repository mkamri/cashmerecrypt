# Hello world~

Last night we were snapped awake to a sudden downpour of rain, hissing at our windows and thumping on the roof. I barely remember rolling over, semi-coherently consoling myself that I really do like the white noise, and drifting off once more into sleep. When I woke up, I learned that the worst was still to come.

After a dreamy day of data design at work, I left early to warnings of tornados, hail, and flash floods. Last night was a preview, I guessed.

Although the only weather that came our way was a 7PM downpour and the rumbling of distant thunder, there was something soft and nostalgic about the way time slows down when on tornado watch. We turned on the TV, watching local news between the same three commercials on repeat. I gazed out the window, trying to discern meaning between the slowly drifting clouds. My partner and I enjoyed dinner together in silence - undistracted by the speed of modern life.

Now that the worst of it is over, I have a whole evening to myself to work on my website and enjoy a few episodes of TV. Today, things are simple. Although there may be a hint of doom around the horizon, right here I have aloeswood incense, miso soup, and a quiet knowing that the world is still spinning just as it always has.
