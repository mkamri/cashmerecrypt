# July Goals

This is a work in progress, but I am trying to figure out what I want for my July goals. In June, I did a drawing/painting challenge where I tried to make one piece of art every day. While it was definitely effective in getting me to drill the fundamentals, I don't really think I had fun with any of it. I didn't create any major works of art that I can look back and be proud of, either.

Here are the things I'm considering as my goals for June:

- Sew an Usakumya rucksack (he's been on my list for a while)
- Sew a plain black skirt to replace the btssb one that's too short
- Finish self-reporting for XP on my [guild](/guild)
- Start working on my pixel art course I bought with some friends
- Continue painting fundamentals

I generally like to pick one art focus and one lifestyle focus. I find that any more than that can be too much. However, perhaps it would be good to have multiple different art focuses, such as both sewing AND code or code AND pixel art, so I can switch things up if I get bored with one or the other.

I'll definitely post whatever I come up with here so stay tuned!
