# Life is Short

I can't believe I'm 29 already. My birthday was a few days ago, and somehow it feels like I should be turning 19, not 29.

I can't believe my high school painting class was 10 years ago. That I spent 10 years not painting -- something that I always considered to be my lifelong passion.

I kept telling myself that I'd paint when I had time, when I had money, when the rest of my life is in order.

I guess maybe it's never going to be in order :)

Today, it is sunny. A few little whispy clouds drift lazily across the sky. The sun peeks through the cheery leaves on the hanging ferns perched around my table.

I've spent too many days at a desk. I am a human, and I love to feel the wind on my face and watch the people go by as I enjoy my meal. On a beautiful day like today, I can't help but feel that life is just too short to eat at a desk.

Life is also too short to put off doing the things you love. Things like painting.

(I finally started my first painting in 10 years... updates coming soon!)
