        <p>I'm <a class="text-bruised hover-bruised" href="/about">mika</a>, and this is my website. Here you will find my outfit pics, art projects, and general ramblings about j-fashion, my artistic process, and whatever else happens to interest me.</p>
        <p>I've been a human on the internet since I was around 8 years old, and I learned to code back in 4th grade. It was always my dream to have a cool personal website, back before social media had even been concieved of yet. I guess I'm killing two birds with one stone by getting away from my dreaded socials and also fulfilling my childhood dream of having a personal website (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)</p>
        <p>This site is eternally under construction, pardon the mess ˙ᵕ˙</p>

                <h2>my style</h2>
                <p>My style has evolved a lot over the years. Currently, I wear mostly j-fashion - a combination of girly-kei and gothic / oldschool lolita in black & white colorways.</p>
                <p>My style has also been heavily influenced by the western goth and industrial movements of the 80's and 90's, which are mostly reflected in my choice of accessories and shoes.</p>
                <p>I've also recently undergone a challenge to learn to sew my own clothes. As a person with sensory issues, I find that many ready-to-wear garments are either uncomfortable or made of fabricts that are irritating to me. Sewing not only reduces support for abusive labor practices in the fashion industry, but it also gives you the opportunity to customize each piece to your own preferences and needs.</p>

                <h2>my art</h2>
                <p>I've had a complicated relationship with art. Although I have always considered myself an artist, and even attended graphic design school for illustration, college and working in the service industry really beat the creativity out of me. I spent a good 5 years totally paralyzed by fear of criticism, terrified that if I posted my work it would somehow be used against me.</p>
                <p>Over the past few years, I've been healing my relationship with art. I completed <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-artists-way-a-spiritual-path-to-higher-creativity-by-julia-cameron/248426/#edition=2583034&idiq=4053640" target="_blank">The Artist's Way</a> with the help of some friends, and created a <a href="https://theunboundcrew.com">creativity guild</a> to connect with like-minded people.</p>
                <p>I'm currently working through the <a href="https://drawabox.com/" target="_blank">drawabox</a> self-taught curriculum. I believe that creativity is a lifelong journey and it's important to be constantly learning and improving. I also have a large 12-part project in the planning phase, so stay tuned for updates!</p>
