        <a href="/egl">â˜œ</a> my wardrobe</h1>
        <p>In January 2024, I rejoined the lolita fashion community. I had made the hard decision to take a hiatus in 2018, partially for my mental health and partially to become more financially stable. I sold all of my pieces and wasn't sure if or when I would return.</p>
        <p>Although the idea of rebuilding from scratch is daunting, it is also an exciting opportunity to build my wardrobe on a solid foundation purchased with intention.</p>
        <p>Check back often to watch my progress!</p>
