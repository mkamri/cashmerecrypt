# 2016-17

During these years I was living with my mom and was just starting to find my footing in lolita fashion.

I became interested in understated yet well-balanced black and white pieces, and finally purchcased my dream dress at the time (Vampire Requiem JSK).

I also learned that comfort is important to me, which led to me selling my dream dress shortly thereafter.
