## Current Warm-Up

Here's my current warm-up routine. I don't always do all of these before drawing, but I'll do a combination of 1-4 of them before working on any serious works.

* 1 page of straight lines (various lengths and directions)
* 1 page of elipses (various sizes and directions)
* 1 page of cubes and spheres
* 1 page of drawing whatever is nearest to me, in its current lighting

## Pinterest Roulette

This has worked great for me: go to Pinterest and pick the VERY FIRST thing that pops up. No further scrolling, this is what you are drawing today. Takes out the decision fatigue and great for a warmpup-enhancer.
