## A New Site
Thank you for visiting my first garden post! I am excited to begin writing posts on things that interest me or that I find useful.

You can expect to see a smattering of posts about art & design, web development, Japanese fashion, and personal posts.

## Trying Again
If you've followed my online journey, you'll know that I have tried and failed to create a garden several times. 

My struggles can be attributed to a few issues:

1. Using WordPress and other bloatware
2. Trying to write for Google's algorithm instead of for myself and my friends
3. Choosing a narrow niche

I plan to remedy these issues by...

1. Using [my own code](https://github.com/mkamri/cashmerecrypt) to develop the theme for this garden, and keeping the code as simple as possible
2. Treating this site as a very personal, social-media-adjacent space to put things that I like (and ignoring Google-sama as much as possible)
3. Selecting whatever random topics interest me, regardless of what "how to start a garden" posts seem to advise
